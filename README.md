# StarWars API Searcher

This is a search application that works with the StarWars API. 
It relies on React for component rendering and state management. Also vanilla javascript ASYNC/AWAIT is used :)

## Getting Started
Clone this repo
Exec `npm install`
Exec `npm run start`

## Usage
Go to `http://localhost:3000` 
The UI is pretty simple, just enter the name of a StarWars character in the input box and hit `Search!` this will hit the API and get back the StarWars movies that have that character.


Enjoy :heart:
